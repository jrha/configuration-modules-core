Updates the /etc/sysconfig/fsprobe configuration.  This is used by
the CERN-CC-fsprobe package to start fsprobe on the relevant file systems.

    options	additional arguments for fsprobe
    syslog	log to syslog
    filesystems	file systems to monitor (regular expressions)
    dir		directory within the file system to test to
    mailsubject subject of mail
    remotefs	allow probing of remote file systems.  Default is local only.

For example,

  "/software/components/fsprobe/active" = true;
  "/software/components/fsprobe/syslog" = true;
  "/software/components/fsprobe/mailto" = "system.admin@cern.ch";
  "/software/components/fsprobe/options" = "--MultiPattern --RndWait --SleepTime 300 --ContinueOnDiff --DumpBuffers "+fsprobedirectio;
