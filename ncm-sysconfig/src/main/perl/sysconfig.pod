=head1 NAME

sysconfig: management of sysconfig files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<sysconfig> component manages system configuration files in 
/etc/sysconfig.  These are files which contain key-value pairs. 
However there is the possibility to add verbatim text either
before or after the key-value pair definitions. 

=head1 FILE DEFINITIONS

=over

=item /software/components/sysconfig/files

This is an nlist which has the file name (unescaped) as the key, and
the content information as the value.  The value is an nlist.

=item /software/components/sysconfig/files/<fname>/

This is a nlist containing key-value pairs.  Both are strings.  
There are two special keys "prologue" and "epilogue" which contain
text which will be copied verbatim into the file before or after 
the pair definitions, respectively. 

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

"/software/components/sysconfig/files/scfg" = 
  nlist("epilogue", "export LANG=C",
        "KEY", "VALUE");

This will create the file /etc/sysconfig/scfg which contains:

KEY=VALUE
export LANG=C
